    ¬†Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts! I'm here to share my genuine experience with the DELL G15 Intel i5-12500H 16GB laptop. Buckle up, as I'm going to be totally candid about the ups and downs I encountered during my laptop-buying adventure.The Pros - What I Loved:-First things first, let's talk about the positives! The DELL G15 impressed me with its smooth handling and those fantastic mouse pad gestures. No more annoying lags or glitches when navigating around! Plus, the sturdy build quality gave me a sense of confidence that this laptop could withstand the test of time.One thing that pleasantly surprised me was that Windows, McAfee, and Office were pre-activated right out of the box. It saved me the hassle of dealing with those activations separately. The keyboard, overall, was a delight to type on. Although there was a slight issue during gaming, it didn't majorly impact my everyday usage.The Cons - The Not-So-Great Stuff:-Now, let's dive into the not-so-great aspects. If you're a hardcore gamer, this might not be the best pick for you. The keyboard gets quite toasty, and I found myself constantly adjusting the fan speed to manage the heat. Without an AC in the summer, it can be a real bummer.While the performance was generally good, I did face some hiccups during gaming, especially in PUBG. I couldn't figure out if it was because of the heat or high RAM consumption. Speaking of RAM, there's an issue with system usage that takes up almost 45% of the 16GB RAM even when there are no resource-intensive tasks running.I tried to tweak things by altering some settings in ""msconfig"" to reduce RAM usage, but it caused problems with the G alien shortcut key and audio jack. A bit of a trade-off there. The laptop is better suited for single-tasking, as running multiple Chrome tabs pushed the RAM utilization to 76-78%.As for battery life, it's not the most impressive, providing only about an hour of backup. So, if you're a person who needs long-lasting battery power, you might want to consider other options.Why I Made This Purchase:-Now, you might be wondering, ""Why on earth did you buy it then?"" Well, I had my reasons. My previous laptop experience with DELL's service support was excellent, so I trusted the brand blindly. Besides, I specifically wanted an Intel processor, and the DELL G15 checked that box perfectly.For my needs, smooth performance and everyday tasks were more important than gaming performance. I mostly use the laptop at home, so I didn't care much about its weight or gaming capabilities. Each person has their unique usage requirements, so consider your own needs before making a decision.The Bottom Line:-To cut to the chase, this laptop suits my personal requirements, but it does come with a fair share of cons. Be sure to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making your own choice. DELL's customer support, especially through WhatsApp, was a significant plus, and it helped me resolve some of the issues.Now regarding Pricing:-I got this DELL G15 for ‚Çπ67,527 on 15th July 2023. The original price was ‚Çπ72,990, but I received an instant discount of ‚Çπ908 through Amazon ICICI, and an additional ‚Çπ1,000 promotional discount was applied. With these discounts, the price reduced to ‚Çπ71,082. And here's the best part: I also received a cashback of ‚Çπ3,554 (5% ICICI Amazon credit card) in my Amazon wallet, further reducing the total cost. So, after considering all the discounts and cashback, the laptop cost me a fantastic ‚Çπ67,527 only.If you find a similar deal between ‚Çπ67,000 to ‚Çπ68,000, it's worth considering. Keep other options open if you're reading this in 2024.So, there you have it, my genuine review of the DELL G15. Keep in mind my experiences, and I hope this helps you in making an informed decision about your dream laptop! Happy tech-hunting!",3.0,

    ¬†Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts! I'm here to share my genuine experience with the DELL G15 Intel i5-12500H 16GB laptop. Buckle up, as I'm going to be totally candid about the ups and downs I encountered during my laptop-buying adventure.The Pros - What I Loved:-First things first, let's talk about the positives! The DELL G15 impressed me with its smooth handling and those fantastic mouse pad gestures. No more annoying lags or glitches when navigating around! Plus, the sturdy build quality gave me a sense of confidence that this laptop could withstand the test of time.One thing that pleasantly surprised me was that Windows, McAfee, and Office were pre-activated right out of the box. It saved me the hassle of dealing with those activations separately. The keyboard, overall, was a delight to type on. Although there was a slight issue during gaming, it didn't majorly impact my everyday usage.The Cons - The Not-So-Great Stuff:-Now, let's dive into the not-so-great aspects. If you're a hardcore gamer, this might not be the best pick for you. The keyboard gets quite toasty, and I found myself constantly adjusting the fan speed to manage the heat. Without an AC in the summer, it can be a real bummer.While the performance was generally good, I did face some hiccups during gaming, especially in PUBG. I couldn't figure out if it was because of the heat or high RAM consumption. Speaking of RAM, there's an issue with system usage that takes up almost 45% of the 16GB RAM even when there are no resource-intensive tasks running.I tried to tweak things by altering some settings in ""msconfig"" to reduce RAM usage, but it caused problems with the G alien shortcut key and audio jack. A bit of a trade-off there. The laptop is better suited for single-tasking, as running multiple Chrome tabs pushed the RAM utilization to 76-78%.As for battery life, it's not the most impressive, providing only about an hour of backup. So, if you're a person who needs long-lasting battery power, you might want to consider other options.Why I Made This Purchase:-Now, you might be wondering, ""Why on earth did you buy it then?"" Well, I had my reasons. My previous laptop experience with DELL's service support was excellent, so I trusted the brand blindly. Besides, I specifically wanted an Intel processor, and the DELL G15 checked that box perfectly.For my needs, smooth performance and everyday tasks were more important than gaming performance. I mostly use the laptop at home, so I didn't care much about its weight or gaming capabilities. Each person has their unique usage requirements, so consider your own needs before making a decision.The Bottom Line:-To cut to the chase, this laptop suits my personal requirements, but it does come with a fair share of cons. Be sure to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making your own choice. DELL's customer support, especially through WhatsApp, was a significant plus, and it helped me resolve some of the issues.Now regarding Pricing:-I got this DELL G15 for ‚Çπ67,527 on 15th July 2023. The original price was ‚Çπ72,990, but I received an instant discount of ‚Çπ908 through Amazon ICICI, and an additional ‚Çπ1,000 promotional discount was applied. With these discounts, the price reduced to ‚Çπ71,082. And here's the best part: I also received a cashback of ‚Çπ3,554 (5% ICICI Amazon credit card) in my Amazon wallet, further reducing the total cost. So, after considering all the discounts and cashback, the laptop cost me a fantastic ‚Çπ67,527 only.If you find a similar deal between ‚Çπ67,000 to ‚Çπ68,000, it's worth considering. Keep other options open if you're reading this in 2024.So, there you have it, my genuine review of the DELL G15. Keep in mind my experiences, and I hope this helps you in making an informed decision about your dream laptop! Happy tech-hunting!",3.0,

Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone",5.0,

    ¬†This lapotp is being advertised as a gaming laptop these days. I'd say it's not so, this is a Powerful Thin and Light laptop. Professionals go for it, Gamers AVOID IT!Okay why's that so, lemme explain the Cons of this for gaming: (I've upgraded my laptop to 16GB Gskill + 1.5TBs of SSD)TLDR: CPU THROTTLES AROUND 12-15W which drops the GPU Usage to 30-40% for any game due to CPU Bottleneck! Acer BIOS Power limits the CPU to 12W.1. The laptop Power adaptor is 90W, with dGPU rtx 2050 going upto 35W alone. This is a MaxQ version of the RTX 2050 which comes in newer budget gaming laptops.2. The GPU is not the issue for gaming here! Yes despite being 35W counterpart it's quite powerful as it's same Ampere based GPU 3050. RTX 3050 + 64Bit = RTX 2050.The real issue lie within the CPU power throttling!3. i5-1240P despite being much powerful CPU, goes upto 45W on inital full load giving awesome performance due to Intel SpeedStep technology, but short after few 10s seconds the CPU throttles around 12-15W TDP ONLY! THIS CAUSES THE CPU TO STUCK ONLY UPTO 0.9-1.1Ghz on full load! This makes any game shutter like hell after just few minutes of the gameplay!4. Thermals ain't a issue for performance! The Laptop has 2 fans which goes upto 6250RPM alone. I thought maybe due to temperature the CPU starts throttling but no even at 60¬∞C temprature (tested with 5Fan cooling pads) the CPU is stuck for the same load. Investing it further in XTU, It's the Acer BIOS Power limit which can't be changed unless acer decides to do something for an Bios update.Coming to the positive part, as i brought it for mostly work purposes apart my office laptop (I'm a Developer) these features are hard to find in any laptop in the segment:1. 12Th gen CPU 12/16 + 4GB RTX 2050. This ensures Coding workload on multiple IDEs, Running Android Emulator is easy!2. Latest Technologies which make it super portable: Thunderbolt 4 coming with Power delivery, Now i charge this and my office laptop with same Type C 60W PD charger of my phone. So You can just take a normal 60W PD charger!3. Wifi 6E is a cheery on top!4. One extra Nvme slot is a plus point!Overall:4.5/5 : Thin and Light portable laptop.1.5/5: Gaming Laptop.",2.0,

Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone",5.0,

Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone",5.0,

Windows 11 pro can be bought on microsoft store if you want encryption of drives.(Bitlocker)21) 1080p resolution lcd screen.I think there are better laptops out there in this price range. I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.Booting speed is good.

    ¬†This lapotp is being advertised as a gaming laptop these days. I'd say it's not so, this is a Powerful Thin and Light laptop. Professionals go for it, Gamers AVOID IT!Okay why's that so, lemme explain the Cons of this for gaming: (I've upgraded my laptop to 16GB Gskill + 1.5TBs of SSD)TLDR: CPU THROTTLES AROUND 12-15W which drops the GPU Usage to 30-40% for any game due to CPU Bottleneck! Acer BIOS Power limits the CPU to 12W.1. The laptop Power adaptor is 90W, with dGPU rtx 2050 going upto 35W alone. This is a MaxQ version of the RTX 2050 which comes in newer budget gaming laptops.2. The GPU is not the issue for gaming here! Yes despite being 35W counterpart it's quite powerful as it's same Ampere based GPU 3050. RTX 3050 + 64Bit = RTX 2050.The real issue lie within the CPU power throttling!3. i5-1240P despite being much powerful CPU, goes upto 45W on inital full load giving awesome performance due to Intel SpeedStep technology, but short after few 10s seconds the CPU throttles around 12-15W TDP ONLY! THIS CAUSES THE CPU TO STUCK ONLY UPTO 0.9-1.1Ghz on full load! This makes any game shutter like hell after just few minutes of the gameplay!4. Thermals ain't a issue for performance! The Laptop has 2 fans which goes upto 6250RPM alone. I thought maybe due to temperature the CPU starts throttling but no even at 60¬∞C temprature (tested with 5Fan cooling pads) the CPU is stuck for the same load. Investing it further in XTU, It's the Acer BIOS Power limit which can't be changed unless acer decides to do something for an Bios update.Coming to the positive part, as i brought it for mostly work purposes apart my office laptop (I'm a Developer) these features are hard to find in any laptop in the segment:1. 12Th gen CPU 12/16 + 4GB RTX 2050. This ensures Coding workload on multiple IDEs, Running Android Emulator is easy!2. Latest Technologies which make it super portable: Thunderbolt 4 coming with Power delivery, Now i charge this and my office laptop with same Type C 60W PD charger of my phone. So You can just take a normal 60W PD charger!3. Wifi 6E is a cheery on top!4. One extra Nvme slot is a plus point!Overall:4.5/5 : Thin and Light portable laptop.1.5/5: Gaming Laptop.",2.0,

I was a bit intrigued about the ingenuity of the deal, however, as you can see, this laptop has it all and for a price of 98K after exchange, this is a steal!I'd like to share my experience with this device so far! The things I loved about this device are:- Amazing 165Hz panel, 1440p resolution, and crystal clear output. For me, it is the perfect resolution, as 1080p is just a bit low and 4k adds unnecessary pressure on the GPU, resulting in a waste of frames and power.- Powerful RTX 3070ti, that too with a max TGP of 150w. This is the solo feature that hooked me to this device. I mean with the TGP like this, you come so close to the max performance of its desktop variants.- Ryzen 7 6800h performs like a champ, both in speed and battery, due to its newer 6nm architecture.- I like OMEN gaming hub, the UI is clear, UX is friendly and I like that you can browse cool wallpapers directly through the app, yes I like to switch wallpapers, five times a day.Now, some of the things that not necessarily are bad for me, but could be for someone else:- Screen Shake is present, but not so aggressive as some YouTube reviews say it has.- The build could have been better, plastic is fine for me as this laptop is probably never going to leave my home desk, but a nice metal build would have been appreciated. But then the weight would have been more than 3.4 Kg, so it's fine what it is.If this comes for a sale! I'd suggest buying this device ASAP. or waiting for almost 6-8 months for the price drop of the newer 4000 series laptops, but, look for the TGP of those devices.",5.0,

After months of research I couldn‚Äôt justify going for a Intel CPU (which are generally expensive comparatively) or the 4060 GPU which has a lower class bus width (performance wise both will be almost same due to increased architecture efficiency). I suggest looking into DLSS Frame generation tech more in case you really want a 40 Class GPU.I have overall been satisfied with this product in about a month‚Äôs time that I have used it. Also, I would suggest removing all bloatware manually (or you can do a clean windows install like I did) but make sure to get the latest OMEN SDK from HPs website to ensure you can control important parameters for performance.",5.0,

I was a bit intrigued about the ingenuity of the deal, however, as you can see, this laptop has it all and for a price of 98K after exchange, this is a steal!I'd like to share my experience with this device so far! The things I loved about this device are:- Amazing 165Hz panel, 1440p resolution, and crystal clear output. For me, it is the perfect resolution, as 1080p is just a bit low and 4k adds unnecessary pressure on the GPU, resulting in a waste of frames and power.- Powerful RTX 3070ti, that too with a max TGP of 150w. This is the solo feature that hooked me to this device. I mean with the TGP like this, you come so close to the max performance of its desktop variants.- Ryzen 7 6800h performs like a champ, both in speed and battery, due to its newer 6nm architecture.- I like OMEN gaming hub, the UI is clear, UX is friendly and I like that you can browse cool wallpapers directly through the app, yes I like to switch wallpapers, five times a day.Now, some of the things that not necessarily are bad for me, but could be for someone else:- Screen Shake is present, but not so aggressive as some YouTube reviews say it has.- The build could have been better, plastic is fine for me as this laptop is probably never going to leave my home desk, but a nice metal build would have been appreciated. But then the weight would have been more than 3.4 Kg, so it's fine what it is.If this comes for a sale! I'd suggest buying this device ASAP. or waiting for almost 6-8 months for the price drop of the newer 4000 series laptops, but, look for the TGP of those devices.",5.0,
