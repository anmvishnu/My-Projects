Extensive packaging, fast (less than 48hrs) and safe delivery.Cons:1) The YouTubers were right when they said the display wobbles. My high-speed ceiling fan was enough to make it wobble. If that's a deal breaker for you, skip the Victus lineup.2) The display rendered colours too warmly. White web pages were rendered cream-coloured. This isn't a problem cuz we could calibrate it ourselves from the display settings, but it's odd that this wasn't done out of the box.3) The backlight on the keyboard is blindingly bright. I couldn't find any option to adjust the brightness.4) The battery life is mediocre. Need to charge it at least twice a day if you're gonna spend most of your waking hours on it.Pros:1) The specification on both Amazon and HP's websites claimed this specific model (16-0351AX) had the RTX 3050 GPU. But the one I got was the RTX 3050 ti (the more powerful version of the 3050).2) The keyboard has a clean style (I like the font of the letters on the keys) and is well spaced. Good tactile feedback. The touchpad is large, smooth, and functional.3) The processor, Ryzen 7 5800H, is unbelievably powerful. Did some light gaming (Football Manager 2021, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Checked HP's built-in Omen software to see how the GPU, CPU, and RAM were faring. The GPU (avg around 45°C) and RAM were at 50%, but the CPU was barely troubled (around 10-15%, avg around 38°C). Unbelievably powerful. The thermals are designed well, nothing got too hot. The fans are set to 'auto', and I could barely hear them. They're pretty quiet and non-intrusive. I toggled the fan speed to 'Max' from HP's Omen settings just to check if they run. When set to max, they're loud and powerful enough to be used as a table fan.I intend to play more demanding games, will update this review after a while.4) HP's calling this the Mica Silver colour. It's matte black. They should just call it matte black. It's neat, understated, and minimalistic. When most gaming laptops look like they're part of the traffic signal lights, you can carry this variant to business meetings and not look like a clown.5) Comes with Microsoft Office 2019. I wasted a few minutes looking for a product key on the laptop and its packaging. But that's not necessary. Just open the Microsoft Word application and it'll auto-verify the in-built product key.6) The anti-reflective coating on the display is great.7) The 512GB SSD here is fast. There's a vacant NVME slot in the laptop too, so can add another 512GB SSD if necessary.8) HP collaborated with Dropbox to give 100gb free cloud storage for a year for those who bought this laptop.",4.0,

There is some flex at the center of the keyboard but nothing major. The design is very understated and looks clean in my opinion. The screen wobbles but not as much to render it unusable. The HDMI port connects directly to the NVIDIA graphics, bypassing OptimusScreen - Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for the 100%srgb variant of the display, you will seriously thank your eyes. The display is very nice with good colors and solid brightness. The 250 nits variant will disappoint you guys, it's not *just* 50 nits less than the 300 nits variant. Nit count is not linear, it's logarithmic. The display out of the box had a slightly yellow tinge but than can easily be fixed in the AMD software.Performance and thermals - The R7 5800H does not break a sweat no matter what you throw at it. It's so darn fast that it almost bottlenecks the RTX 3050. In other words, the RTX 3050 would be sweating at 100% usage while the r7 5800h would be chilling at 25% usage. Talking about thermals, the CPU does reach 100 degrees Celcius if you are playing a demanding game(Ryzen chips go up to 105 degrees) but it's nothing to worry about. The WASD area stays cool. The fans will make noise and if you are in a quiet environment, I would recommend a pair of headphones for a better experience.Battery Life - Don't expect wonders here, 4-5 hours on light usage. Maybe 6 hours if you change it to 60hz but nothing too special.Some things I did not like: 1. The bottom bezel could have been smaller 2. The keyboard backlight is blindingly bright, there is no option to toggle the brightness of those LEDs, It's just on or off. 3. 2 USB ports on the right side 4.

Extensive packaging, fast (less than 48hrs) and safe delivery.Cons:1) The YouTubers were right when they said the display wobbles. My high-speed ceiling fan was enough to make it wobble. If that's a deal breaker for you, skip the Victus lineup.2) The display rendered colours too warmly. White web pages were rendered cream-coloured. This isn't a problem cuz we could calibrate it ourselves from the display settings, but it's odd that this wasn't done out of the box.3) The backlight on the keyboard is blindingly bright. I couldn't find any option to adjust the brightness.4) The battery life is mediocre. Need to charge it at least twice a day if you're gonna spend most of your waking hours on it.Pros:1) The specification on both Amazon and HP's websites claimed this specific model (16-0351AX) had the RTX 3050 GPU. But the one I got was the RTX 3050 ti (the more powerful version of the 3050).2) The keyboard has a clean style (I like the font of the letters on the keys) and is well spaced. Good tactile feedback. The touchpad is large, smooth, and functional.3) The processor, Ryzen 7 5800H, is unbelievably powerful. Did some light gaming (Football Manager 2021, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Checked HP's built-in Omen software to see how the GPU, CPU, and RAM were faring. The GPU (avg around 45°C) and RAM were at 50%, but the CPU was barely troubled (around 10-15%, avg around 38°C). Unbelievably powerful. The thermals are designed well, nothing got too hot. The fans are set to 'auto', and I could barely hear them. They're pretty quiet and non-intrusive. I toggled the fan speed to 'Max' from HP's Omen settings just to check if they run. When set to max, they're loud and powerful enough to be used as a table fan.I intend to play more demanding games, will update this review after a while.4) HP's calling this the Mica Silver colour. It's matte black. They should just call it matte black. It's neat, understated, and minimalistic. When most gaming laptops look like they're part of the traffic signal lights, you can carry this variant to business meetings and not look like a clown.5) Comes with Microsoft Office 2019. I wasted a few minutes looking for a product key on the laptop and its packaging. But that's not necessary. Just open the Microsoft Word application and it'll auto-verify the in-built product key.6) The anti-reflective coating on the display is great.7) The 512GB SSD here is fast. There's a vacant NVME slot in the laptop too, so can add another 512GB SSD if necessary.8) HP collaborated with Dropbox to give 100gb free cloud storage for a year for those who bought this laptop.",4.0,

There is some flex at the center of the keyboard but nothing major. The design is very understated and looks clean in my opinion. The screen wobbles but not as much to render it unusable. The HDMI port connects directly to the NVIDIA graphics, bypassing OptimusScreen - Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for the 100%srgb variant of the display, you will seriously thank your eyes. The display is very nice with good colors and solid brightness. The 250 nits variant will disappoint you guys, it's not *just* 50 nits less than the 300 nits variant. Nit count is not linear, it's logarithmic. The display out of the box had a slightly yellow tinge but than can easily be fixed in the AMD software.Performance and thermals - The R7 5800H does not break a sweat no matter what you throw at it. It's so darn fast that it almost bottlenecks the RTX 3050. In other words, the RTX 3050 would be sweating at 100% usage while the r7 5800h would be chilling at 25% usage. Talking about thermals, the CPU does reach 100 degrees Celcius if you are playing a demanding game(Ryzen chips go up to 105 degrees) but it's nothing to worry about. The WASD area stays cool. The fans will make noise and if you are in a quiet environment, I would recommend a pair of headphones for a better experience.Battery Life - Don't expect wonders here, 4-5 hours on light usage. Maybe 6 hours if you change it to 60hz but nothing too special.Some things I did not like: 1. The bottom bezel could have been smaller 2. The keyboard backlight is blindingly bright, there is no option to toggle the brightness of those LEDs, It's just on or off. 3. 2 USB ports on the right side 4. It's heavy (but that's subjective)Software Included - MS Office 2021 [Lifetime] Dropbox 100GB [1 year] ExpressVPN [1 month] AlexaAll in all, a solid laptop. 8.5/10",5.0,

I am running AAA titles Horizon Zero Dawn, RDR2 and Elden Ring at Ultra without any issues. Having seen some people complain about things please see below points:-Heating :- Yes the laptop heats up when running heavy games, this is normal, the fans pump a lot of hot air out, this is not gonna win any awards for heat dissipation but it does the job. I have not experienced any thermal throttling despite gaming for 4+ hours continuously. Armory crate profile's can be set up, some come inbuilt to regulate the fan speeds and other settings.WIFI - This comes with WIFI 6, but could have issues with older 2.4 networks. If you are a gamer you are using ethernet anyway so doesn't matter.Expansion: Comes with 2 x 8 GB sticks can upgrade them to 2 x 16 if required in the future. Has 2 X M.2 NVMe 2280 slots so options to add storage is also there.I/O - 3 x USB 3. 1 x HDMI, 1 x USB - C :-You can connect a USB-C dock for additional ports. If you want to use G-Sync you need a USB-C to DP adapter/dock to connect to supported monitor (USB-C only has direct graphics card out)I have used this for 1 month and i am happy with the product.If you want a gaming laptop and don't have enough to buy an ROG of the same spec.

Plus really enjoyed the graphics - almost felt 100Ks are well spent. Games I tried so far are BattleField 1 and 5.But heats up very quickly in Balanced Mode while playing. So I did not even dare to try the Turbo mode. More specifically, the issue is that one of the path the heat dissipates through is from right hand side panel near where I keep my mouse. The heat comes directly on the mouse hand.As a solution I have started playing by keeping laptop and chair at 45 degree angle to table. That way I let my elbow rest on table and also get a lot of space to move my mouse while keeping my hand distant from right side panel.But otherwise heat control is good while working normally. Battery backup is also too good for me during normal working.All in all good product for less than 100k. I guess it was worth the while to wait this long to buy this model.",3.0,

Having seen some people complain about things please see below points:-Heating :- Yes the laptop heats up when running heavy games, this is normal, the fans pump a lot of hot air out, this is not gonna win any awards for heat dissipation but it does the job. I have not experienced any thermal throttling despite gaming for 4+ hours continuously. Armory crate profile's can be set up, some come inbuilt to regulate the fan speeds and other settings.WIFI - This comes with WIFI 6, but could have issues with older 2.4 networks. If you are a gamer you are using ethernet anyway so doesn't matter.Expansion: Comes with 2 x 8 GB sticks can upgrade them to 2 x 16 if required in the future. Has 2 X M.2 NVMe 2280 slots so options to add storage is also there.I/O - 3 x USB 3. 1 x HDMI, 1 x USB - C :-You can connect a USB-C dock for additional ports. If you want to use G-Sync you need a USB-C to DP adapter/dock to connect to supported monitor (USB-C only has direct graphics card out)I have used this for 1 month and i am happy with the product.If you want a gaming laptop and don't have enough to buy an ROG of the same spec.

I have not experienced any thermal throttling despite gaming for 4+ hours continuously. Armory crate profile's can be set up, some come inbuilt to regulate the fan speeds and other settings.WIFI - This comes with WIFI 6, but could have issues with older 2.4 networks.

Plus really enjoyed the graphics - almost felt 100Ks are well spent. Games I tried so far are BattleField 1 and 5.But heats up very quickly in Balanced Mode while playing. So I did not even dare to try the Turbo mode. More specifically, the issue is that one of the path the heat dissipates through is from right hand side panel near where I keep my mouse. The heat comes directly on the mouse hand.As a solution I have started playing by keeping laptop and chair at 45 degree angle to table. That way I let my elbow rest on table and also get a lot of space to move my mouse while keeping my hand distant from right side panel.But otherwise heat control is good while working normally. Battery backup is also too good for me during normal working.All in all good product for less than 100k. I guess it was worth the while to wait this long to buy this model.",3.0,

The heat comes directly on the mouse hand.As a solution I have started playing by keeping laptop and chair at 45 degree angle to table. That way I let my elbow rest on table and also get a lot of space to move my mouse while keeping my hand distant from right side panel.But otherwise heat control is good while working normally.

Set the minimum below 5-10% and it should idle around 50°, very important aspect to know if you want it to last long without slowing.The laptop is very well priced in fact it's difficult to find one for it's price.

I am running AAA titles Horizon Zero Dawn, RDR2 and Elden Ring at Ultra without any issues. Having seen some people complain about things please see below points:-Heating :- Yes the laptop heats up when running heavy games, this is normal, the fans pump a lot of hot air out, this is not gonna win any awards for heat dissipation but it does the job. I have not experienced any thermal throttling despite gaming for 4+ hours continuously. Armory crate profile's can be set up, some come inbuilt to regulate the fan speeds and other settings.WIFI - This comes with WIFI 6, but could have issues with older 2.4 networks. If you are a gamer you are using ethernet anyway so doesn't matter.Expansion: Comes with 2 x 8 GB sticks can upgrade them to 2 x 16 if required in the future. Has 2 X M.2 NVMe 2280 slots so options to add storage is also there.I/O - 3 x USB 3. 1 x HDMI, 1 x USB - C :-You can connect a USB-C dock for additional ports. If you want to use G-Sync you need a USB-C to DP adapter/dock to connect to supported monitor (USB-C only has direct graphics card out)I have used this for 1 month and i am happy with the product.If you want a gaming laptop and don't have enough to buy an ROG of the same spec.

     This is well balanced for heavy work and gaming.

SSD has write speed of 700+MB/s (same ssd drive), 100%sRGB display. Great Thermals in performance mode. Graphics Switcher from Omen App and from Bios too. Ports at back side are awesome to clear the wire clutter. 16GB DDR5 5200Mhz is awesome.

I was a bit intrigued about the ingenuity of the deal, however, as you can see, this laptop has it all and for a price of 98K after exchange, this is a steal!I'd like to share my experience with this device so far! The things I loved about this device are:- Amazing 165Hz panel, 1440p resolution, and crystal clear output. For me, it is the perfect resolution, as 1080p is just a bit low and 4k adds unnecessary pressure on the GPU, resulting in a waste of frames and power.- Powerful RTX 3070ti, that too with a max TGP of 150w. This is the solo feature that hooked me to this device. I mean with the TGP like this, you come so close to the max performance of its desktop variants.- Ryzen 7 6800h performs like a champ, both in speed and battery, due to its newer 6nm architecture.- I like OMEN gaming hub, the UI is clear, UX is friendly and I like that you can browse cool wallpapers directly through the app, yes I like to switch wallpapers, five times a day.Now, some of the things that not necessarily are bad for me, but could be for someone else:- Screen Shake is present, but not so aggressive as some YouTube reviews say it has.- The build could have been better, plastic is fine for me as this laptop is probably never going to leave my home desk, but a nice metal build would have been appreciated. But then the weight would have been more than 3.4 Kg, so it's fine what it is.If this comes for a sale! I'd suggest buying this device ASAP. or waiting for almost 6-8 months for the price drop of the newer 4000 series laptops, but, look for the TGP of those devices.",5.0,

Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features 😭 you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone",5.0,

     This lapotp is being advertised as a gaming laptop these days. I'd say it's not so, this is a Powerful Thin and Light laptop. Professionals go for it, Gamers AVOID IT!Okay why's that so, lemme explain the Cons of this for gaming: (I've upgraded my laptop to 16GB Gskill + 1.5TBs of SSD)TLDR: CPU THROTTLES AROUND 12-15W which drops the GPU Usage to 30-40% for any game due to CPU Bottleneck! Acer BIOS Power limits the CPU to 12W.1. The laptop Power adaptor is 90W, with dGPU rtx 2050 going upto 35W alone. This is a MaxQ version of the RTX 2050 which comes in newer budget gaming laptops.2. The GPU is not the issue for gaming here! Yes despite being 35W counterpart it's quite powerful as it's same Ampere based GPU 3050. RTX 3050 + 64Bit = RTX 2050.The real issue lie within the CPU power throttling!3. i5-1240P despite being much powerful CPU, goes upto 45W on inital full load giving awesome performance due to Intel SpeedStep technology, but short after few 10s seconds the CPU throttles around 12-15W TDP ONLY! THIS CAUSES THE CPU TO STUCK ONLY UPTO 0.9-1.1Ghz on full load! This makes any game shutter like hell after just few minutes of the gameplay!4. Thermals ain't a issue for performance! The Laptop has 2 fans which goes upto 6250RPM alone. I thought maybe due to temperature the CPU starts throttling but no even at 60°C temprature (tested with 5Fan cooling pads) the CPU is stuck for the same load. Investing it further in XTU, It's the Acer BIOS Power limit which can't be changed unless acer decides to do something for an Bios update.Coming to the positive part, as i brought it for mostly work purposes apart my office laptop (I'm a Developer) these features are hard to find in any laptop in the segment:1. 12Th gen CPU 12/16 + 4GB RTX 2050. This ensures Coding workload on multiple IDEs, Running Android Emulator is easy!2. Latest Technologies which make it super portable: Thunderbolt 4 coming with Power delivery, Now i charge this and my office laptop with same Type C 60W PD charger of my phone. So You can just take a normal 60W PD charger!3. Wifi 6E is a cheery on top!4. One extra Nvme slot is a plus point!Overall:4.5/5 : Thin and Light portable laptop.1.5/5: Gaming Laptop.",2.0,

Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features 😭 you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone",5.0,

Only one vent on the right top of the laptop below the screen.11) Gets very hot not suitable to place on lap or it will burn your skin.Pros: 1) Decent Screen quality and size2) 3 usb slots( 2 on left and one on right) + Thunderbolt slot +lan cable slot + HDMI slot + 3.5mm headphone jack included3) Decent for video and audio editing4) Not made for hardcore gamers or graphic editing5) Battery is 1.3 hours backup6) HD webcam included7) Mouse trackpad is good and it has fingerprint reader on the left of trackpad8) Wifi 6E (Removable adapter inside the laptop)9) 256GB NVME SSD included.

But bluetooth mic should be of good quality.16) Runs hot during gaming.17) Medium weight laptop and a bit thick.18) Aluminium frame. Does leak a bit of current on the top of laptop when you touch it. It can be solved with proper earthing wire.19) Suggested to buy another keyboard and mouse so that you dont damage its keyboard inbuilt.20) Supports windows 11 home. Windows 11 pro can be bought on microsoft store if you want encryption of drives.(Bitlocker)21) 1080p resolution lcd screen.I think there are better laptops out there in this price range. I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.Booting speed is good. Boots under 5 seconds.",4.0,

Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at allIt doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for itNo free features 😭 you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto youI just hope this long review could help someone",5.0,

     This lapotp is being advertised as a gaming laptop these days. I'd say it's not so, this is a Powerful Thin and Light laptop. Professionals go for it, Gamers AVOID IT!Okay why's that so, lemme explain the Cons of this for gaming: (I've upgraded my laptop to 16GB Gskill + 1.5TBs of SSD)TLDR: CPU THROTTLES AROUND 12-15W which drops the GPU Usage to 30-40% for any game due to CPU Bottleneck! Acer BIOS Power limits the CPU to 12W.1. The laptop Power adaptor is 90W, with dGPU rtx 2050 going upto 35W alone. This is a MaxQ version of the RTX 2050 which comes in newer budget gaming laptops.2. The GPU is not the issue for gaming here! Yes despite being 35W counterpart it's quite powerful as it's same Ampere based GPU 3050. RTX 3050 + 64Bit = RTX 2050.The real issue lie within the CPU power throttling!3. i5-1240P despite being much powerful CPU, goes upto 45W on inital full load giving awesome performance due to Intel SpeedStep technology, but short after few 10s seconds the CPU throttles around 12-15W TDP ONLY! THIS CAUSES THE CPU TO STUCK ONLY UPTO 0.9-1.1Ghz on full load! This makes any game shutter like hell after just few minutes of the gameplay!4. Thermals ain't a issue for performance! The Laptop has 2 fans which goes upto 6250RPM alone. I thought maybe due to temperature the CPU starts throttling but no even at 60°C temprature (tested with 5Fan cooling pads) the CPU is stuck for the same load. Investing it further in XTU, It's the Acer BIOS Power limit which can't be changed unless acer decides to do something for an Bios update.Coming to the positive part, as i brought it for mostly work purposes apart my office laptop (I'm a Developer) these features are hard to find in any laptop in the segment:1. 12Th gen CPU 12/16 + 4GB RTX 2050. This ensures Coding workload on multiple IDEs, Running Android Emulator is easy!2. Latest Technologies which make it super portable: Thunderbolt 4 coming with Power delivery, Now i charge this and my office laptop with same Type C 60W PD charger of my phone. So You can just take a normal 60W PD charger!3. Wifi 6E is a cheery on top!4. One extra Nvme slot is a plus point!Overall:4.5/5 : Thin and Light portable laptop.1.5/5: Gaming Laptop.",2.0,

I suggest looking into DLSS Frame generation tech more in case you really want a 40 Class GPU.I have overall been satisfied with this product in about a month’s time that I have used it.

I was a bit intrigued about the ingenuity of the deal, however, as you can see, this laptop has it all and for a price of 98K after exchange, this is a steal!I'd like to share my experience with this device so far! The things I loved about this device are:- Amazing 165Hz panel, 1440p resolution, and crystal clear output. For me, it is the perfect resolution, as 1080p is just a bit low and 4k adds unnecessary pressure on the GPU, resulting in a waste of frames and power.- Powerful RTX 3070ti, that too with a max TGP of 150w. This is the solo feature that hooked me to this device. I mean with the TGP like this, you come so close to the max performance of its desktop variants.- Ryzen 7 6800h performs like a champ, both in speed and battery, due to its newer 6nm architecture.- I like OMEN gaming hub, the UI is clear, UX is friendly and I like that you can browse cool wallpapers directly through the app, yes I like to switch wallpapers, five times a day.Now, some of the things that not necessarily are bad for me, but could be for someone else:- Screen Shake is present, but not so aggressive as some YouTube reviews say it has.- The build could have been better, plastic is fine for me as this laptop is probably never going to leave my home desk, but a nice metal build would have been appreciated. But then the weight would have been more than 3.4 Kg, so it's fine what it is.If this comes for a sale!

Weak speakers, poor memory configuration choice, inability to upgrade without voiding warranty or submitting to extortion by Acer are the weakest bits. I'll add a few more. I also have an Asus Zephyrus G15 (6900HS+RTX3080) and an outgoing HP Victus (RTX 3050Ti), so I'll reference those two along the way.1. Thermal limit of GPU is reached very early, even earlier than CPU. This is especially a problem in GPU-bound workloads like Stable Diffusion. Almost every laptop is thermally constrained, but most of them try and keep the GPU well-cooled so throttling is usually  noticed only with CPU-intensive workloads. This GPU hits 87C and throttles at 110-120W if the ambient temperature is ~30C. When running in AC airflow, upto 150W is possible (the air from AC is typically cooler than the final ambient). In the maxed out mode nothing much changes except it runs noisier and cooler, but power limits remain similar. I have seen anomalous peaks to 200W, so the laptop has sufficient power budget, it's the cooling that is very poorly designed.As others have noted, CPU will go to thermal limit when GPU is stressed, even with minimal CPU load. It's due to cross-loading of the cooling solution, which is not allowing each component to run at optimal temperature. By contrast, the Asus Zephyrus G15/RTX 3080 I also have, runs the GPU and CPU to limit individually and cross-loaded heating is significantly less (though still present, obviously). That GPU has never hit thermal limit even in 30C room, and does burst to the 140W range, and runs long term at 120W no issues - in a chassis that is significantly smaller and lighter. The difference is in the metal budget for the Nitro, which is much lower to save cost. You wanna know why it's cheap? Because they undersized the cooling solution.2. Screen panel is very good. It's probably the exact same one as the one in the aforementioned G15, which is a good start. Unfortunately the factory ""calibration"" is not. My screen came with a strong green tint, which took some time to get rid of. The backlight is the bigger issue, it is spotty and weak in many areas, and stupid bright in others resulting in a very uneven image. There goes my consideration of buying an Acer monitor.3. The Acer warranty is void if you open the laptop for any reason whatsoever, even to upgrade parts that are considered user-replaceable and upgradeable. I have a friend who is disabled and unable to travel, and Acer confirmed to him that there is no way to access the internals without visiting the service center, regardless of the customer's physical status (obviously, he ended up not buying it, but I did). This is specific to India, in most regions the sticker they put on the screw hole is illegal. But this is India, so you're stuck as a consumer. It's a shame to have multiple SSD slots and a RAM configuration that throttles performance, and not be able to do anything about it. Needless to say this is the last Acer product I will be buying. Does not seem a consumer-centric company.4. The RAM configuration is egregious. 16GB is indeed enough for this laptop. The Acer apps have a very small footprint and memory usage is just about 4GB (the G15 uses close to 6GB with the default setup including Asus bloatware). Unfortunately a single stick is what you get, and that absolutely kills the laptop when you want to do something memory-intensive. Just loading up large files (like a SD checkpoint or a large 3D file) from disk into the GPU slow this thing down to the point of being unusable. Gaming is not an issue for the most part, because the laptop is thermally constrained at all times anyway and also restricted by the pathetic memory bandwidth. Want to start your small business? Don't get this thing. It will slow you down.5. The fans are LOUD. They also have a very annoying high-pitched whine at about 8KHz, which pierces my ears when the laptop is in front of me. You would think it's coil whine, but it's not. If I max the fans manually with zero CPU/GPU load, I get this shrill wail that physically hurts. And they're loud, like 60dB+ loud. Louder than the speakers, which are for some reason present on this laptop. It doesn't need speakers, it needs an intervention.6. The keyboard. OMG the keyboard. It is spongy, cramped, the numpad is a format unknown to man and the keys have no feel and no feedback. Not expecting something great, but the HP Victus I have has a significantly better keyboard. The only positive of the Acer is that the keys are translucent and not transparent like the G15, so it's possible to use it without needing to switch on some glitzy lighting.7. The battery. Not the battery life, that I knew was not going to be great, but the wear. It had 0% wear when I got it, and after about 10 power cycles it's up to 3% wear. Literally degrading before my eyes. The G15 is worse, after <1 year it's at 7% and the Victus is much better, close to 2 years in and 0%. I don't think Acer (or Asus) have their A-game down on battery and power management. At least Asus took 4 months to get to 3%.Eventually, I decided to dock the laptop instead of using it as a portable unit. It is unusable as a unit to move around with, and use as a laptop (in front of me). There are a few good things - the deck stays cool for the most part, the Acer software is good, and the CPU is reasonably competent if you are not using it as a workstation. There are plenty of upgrade options (thumbs up), but all of them are pointless because you can't upgrade them yourself (thumbs down).Overall, there are just too many issues with the device for me to recommend it. The fact it's cheap does not surprise me. After using it for a week or so, I'd say it is worth probably less than I paid for it. The GPU is a rubber stamp. In actual use in typical environments, it is nowhere close to its potential due to thermal issues and single-channel memory. And that is really the only standout feature. I don't think that it's sufficient, not with the cooling they have on it.",3.0,

It heats a lot, the cooling system is not enough for a 150 watt TGP graphic card, the moment I run a game within a few seconds, the temp crosses 90° C ( if you are going to play high graphics games run it with custom fan speed with the max possible rpm.2. It has excellent upgradibility options, but it's not user friendly as it requires one to visit their nearest acer service centre to do so because of the back panel seal, removing which by own will void the warranty.3. The upgradibility options and capacity to which it is upgradable is not mentioned any where, the user is either dependent on service centre employees or acer community website for identifying those.4. The back panel is fingerprint magnet and will require one to clean it regularly with a microfibre cloth, as it doesn't clear with normal cloth. Micro fibre cloth can be obtained from spectacles cases.5. 16 gb ram is sufficient to run any games at Max settings possible but it is in single slot means, the system is unable to utilize the max processing power. It could have been good if they provided a dual channel 8 gb ram on both slot as upgrading it will require one to visit the service centre and pay the staff. Also ddr 4 rams are very cheap so in future one could have replaced both the rams easily.6. Battery capacity is very less, although it's of no use as gaming requires it be plugged in. But one can increase battery output by reducing the refresh rate to 60 hz from 165 hz, turning screen brightness low and switching off the keypad lights when using outside away from power source.7. As I said earlier there is too much confusion about the upgradibility options, whether you need an 1tb ssd or 2 tb ssd, I contacted the customer care on acer website and asked about the max upgradibility on the ssd slot, they said it is upto 1tb ssd but in the acer community there are people who have done 2 tb per slot . The sata hdd bracket can also support  sata ssd according to acer community users but the customer care only said about hdd option.8. The international market have the same laptop with i7 12700 processor which have more cores and threads than than i7 12650 processor available in Indian market at a very competitive pricing.9. The RJ45 ethernet cable port is very weird and difficult to use. Without proper knowledge one can damage the setup.10. One planning to purchase this model should also save money to invest in cooling system (Klim mistral model it is more effective than those nonsense cooling pad). And also I would recommend to invest in some gaming mouse and keyboard as after placing the laptop on cooling pad it not going to be easy to use it.11. The SNID and serial no is provided on the bottom of the laptop which is required to register your product and obtain the warranty.12. The thunderbolt 4 port present on the back side is fully functional, and it even supports charging but only upto 5V 3A (15W) which is not recommended for use during gaming.13. The screen is similar to 100% sRGB so good with colour accuracy task, but it's performance is not uniform all over the screen, more information on this can be found online.14. If you want to know about the compatibility of ram and ssd before purchasing it online you can check so by using the compatibility tool from crucial website which tells you specifically which model ram and ssd is supported by your system and you can note down the specs and search from other brands if you desire so.15. To get max performance as seen on the youtube by reviewers, turn fan speed to max, shift graphic card to discrete GPU from nitro sense software.",4.0,

So i would call it a decent speaker with not much good qualities to it.Mux switch will come in handy if you know that you are going to play coniltinously with power adapter connected.Overall answer is that this is the best gaming experience laptop at this price point. Not the new RTX 4060 laptops as the RTX 4060 is a joke when compared with RTX 3070 Ti. But if you can spend 20k INR more, then try the all AMD Asus strix g15 advantage edition with the RX6800M and Ryzen 9 5950HX. The processor is 3 years old, and even the GPU is more than 2 years old, but the raw rasterization performance of the RX6800M is comparable to  a RTX 3080 laptop. So there is nothing even close to that powerhouse at that price range of 1.3 lakh INR.So either get this RTX 3070 Ti laptop for 1 lakh and count on Nvidia's DLSS to deliver flagship level performance or buy the RX6800M laptop for 1.3 lakh and be the proud owner of a flagship GPU.",5.0,

(3 TB total)3. Bought a simple cooling pad (They all work almost equally irrespective of no of fans and size).Everything included costed me less than 105k. Works better and faster than most 150k laptops I have tried.Apart from that, polycarbonate built but quite solid. Both looks and feels strong. Sturdy hinge and minimal top and keyboard flex.Very fast and responsive screen with high color accuracy. (I upgraded from a TN panel display laptop)Decent keyboard for both gaming and typing. Big and quite responsive trackpad.Downsides: DDR4 RAM. However, compared to DDR5 the performance difference should be around 5%, so hardly matters and not worth the extra cost.Overall a solid recommendation for those who want pure performance and not novalty features like per key RGB, metal chassis built or inbuilt mechanical keyboard, etc.",5.0,

Weak speakers, poor memory configuration choice, inability to upgrade without voiding warranty or submitting to extortion by Acer are the weakest bits. I'll add a few more. I also have an Asus Zephyrus G15 (6900HS+RTX3080) and an outgoing HP Victus (RTX 3050Ti), so I'll reference those two along the way.1. Thermal limit of GPU is reached very early, even earlier than CPU. This is especially a problem in GPU-bound workloads like Stable Diffusion. Almost every laptop is thermally constrained, but most of them try and keep the GPU well-cooled so throttling is usually  noticed only with CPU-intensive workloads. This GPU hits 87C and throttles at 110-120W if the ambient temperature is ~30C. When running in AC airflow, upto 150W is possible (the air from AC is typically cooler than the final ambient). In the maxed out mode nothing much changes except it runs noisier and cooler, but power limits remain similar. I have seen anomalous peaks to 200W, so the laptop has sufficient power budget, it's the cooling that is very poorly designed.As others have noted, CPU will go to thermal limit when GPU is stressed, even with minimal CPU load. It's due to cross-loading of the cooling solution, which is not allowing each component to run at optimal temperature. By contrast, the Asus Zephyrus G15/RTX 3080 I also have, runs the GPU and CPU to limit individually and cross-loaded heating is significantly less (though still present, obviously). That GPU has never hit thermal limit even in 30C room, and does burst to the 140W range, and runs long term at 120W no issues - in a chassis that is significantly smaller and lighter. The difference is in the metal budget for the Nitro, which is much lower to save cost. You wanna know why it's cheap? Because they undersized the cooling solution.2. Screen panel is very good. It's probably the exact same one as the one in the aforementioned G15, which is a good start. Unfortunately the factory ""calibration"" is not. My screen came with a strong green tint, which took some time to get rid of. The backlight is the bigger issue, it is spotty and weak in many areas, and stupid bright in others resulting in a very uneven image. There goes my consideration of buying an Acer monitor.3. The Acer warranty is void if you open the laptop for any reason whatsoever, even to upgrade parts that are considered user-replaceable and upgradeable. I have a friend who is disabled and unable to travel, and Acer confirmed to him that there is no way to access the internals without visiting the service center, regardless of the customer's physical status (obviously, he ended up not buying it, but I did). This is specific to India, in most regions the sticker they put on the screw hole is illegal. But this is India, so you're stuck as a consumer. It's a shame to have multiple SSD slots and a RAM configuration that throttles performance, and not be able to do anything about it. Needless to say this is the last Acer product I will be buying. Does not seem a consumer-centric company.4. The RAM configuration is egregious. 16GB is indeed enough for this laptop. The Acer apps have a very small footprint and memory usage is just about 4GB (the G15 uses close to 6GB with the default setup including Asus bloatware). Unfortunately a single stick is what you get, and that absolutely kills the laptop when you want to do something memory-intensive. Just loading up large files (like a SD checkpoint or a large 3D file) from disk into the GPU slow this thing down to the point of being unusable. Gaming is not an issue for the most part, because the laptop is thermally constrained at all times anyway and also restricted by the pathetic memory bandwidth. Want to start your small business? Don't get this thing. It will slow you down.5. The fans are LOUD. They also have a very annoying high-pitched whine at about 8KHz, which pierces my ears when the laptop is in front of me. You would think it's coil whine, but it's not. If I max the fans manually with zero CPU/GPU load, I get this shrill wail that physically hurts. And they're loud, like 60dB+ loud. Louder than the speakers, which are for some reason present on this laptop. It doesn't need speakers, it needs an intervention.6. The keyboard. OMG the keyboard. It is spongy, cramped, the numpad is a format unknown to man and the keys have no feel and no feedback. Not expecting something great, but the HP Victus I have has a significantly better keyboard. The only positive of the Acer is that the keys are translucent and not transparent like the G15, so it's possible to use it without needing to switch on some glitzy lighting.7. The battery. Not the battery life, that I knew was not going to be great, but the wear. It had 0% wear when I got it, and after about 10 power cycles it's up to 3% wear. Literally degrading before my eyes. The G15 is worse, after <1 year it's at 7% and the Victus is much better, close to 2 years in and 0%. I don't think Acer (or Asus) have their A-game down on battery and power management. At least Asus took 4 months to get to 3%.Eventually, I decided to dock the laptop instead of using it as a portable unit. It is unusable as a unit to move around with, and use as a laptop (in front of me). There are a few good things - the deck stays cool for the most part, the Acer software is good, and the CPU is reasonably competent if you are not using it as a workstation. There are plenty of upgrade options (thumbs up), but all of them are pointless because you can't upgrade them yourself (thumbs down).Overall, there are just too many issues with the device for me to recommend it. The fact it's cheap does not surprise me. After using it for a week or so, I'd say it is worth probably less than I paid for it. The GPU is a rubber stamp. In actual use in typical environments, it is nowhere close to its potential due to thermal issues and single-channel memory. And that is really the only standout feature. I don't think that it's sufficient, not with the cooling they have on it.",3.0,

It heats a lot, the cooling system is not enough for a 150 watt TGP graphic card, the moment I run a game within a few seconds, the temp crosses 90° C ( if you are going to play high graphics games run it with custom fan speed with the max possible rpm.2. It has excellent upgradibility options, but it's not user friendly as it requires one to visit their nearest acer service centre to do so because of the back panel seal, removing which by own will void the warranty.3. The upgradibility options and capacity to which it is upgradable is not mentioned any where, the user is either dependent on service centre employees or acer community website for identifying those.4. The back panel is fingerprint magnet and will require one to clean it regularly with a microfibre cloth, as it doesn't clear with normal cloth. Micro fibre cloth can be obtained from spectacles cases.5. 16 gb ram is sufficient to run any games at Max settings possible but it is in single slot means, the system is unable to utilize the max processing power. It could have been good if they provided a dual channel 8 gb ram on both slot as upgrading it will require one to visit the service centre and pay the staff. Also ddr 4 rams are very cheap so in future one could have replaced both the rams easily.6. Battery capacity is very less, although it's of no use as gaming requires it be plugged in. But one can increase battery output by reducing the refresh rate to 60 hz from 165 hz, turning screen brightness low and switching off the keypad lights when using outside away from power source.7. As I said earlier there is too much confusion about the upgradibility options, whether you need an 1tb ssd or 2 tb ssd, I contacted the customer care on acer website and asked about the max upgradibility on the ssd slot, they said it is upto 1tb ssd but in the acer community there are people who have done 2 tb per slot . The sata hdd bracket can also support  sata ssd according to acer community users but the customer care only said about hdd option.8. The international market have the same laptop with i7 12700 processor which have more cores and threads than than i7 12650 processor available in Indian market at a very competitive pricing.9. The RJ45 ethernet cable port is very weird and difficult to use. Without proper knowledge one can damage the setup.10. One planning to purchase this model should also save money to invest in cooling system (Klim mistral model it is more effective than those nonsense cooling pad). And also I would recommend to invest in some gaming mouse and keyboard as after placing the laptop on cooling pad it not going to be easy to use it.11. The SNID and serial no is provided on the bottom of the laptop which is required to register your product and obtain the warranty.12. The thunderbolt 4 port present on the back side is fully functional, and it even supports charging but only upto 5V 3A (15W) which is not recommended for use during gaming.13. The screen is similar to 100% sRGB so good with colour accuracy task, but it's performance is not uniform all over the screen, more information on this can be found online.14. If you want to know about the compatibility of ram and ssd before purchasing it online you can check so by using the compatibility tool from crucial website which tells you specifically which model ram and ssd is supported by your system and you can note down the specs and search from other brands if you desire so.15. To get max performance as seen on the youtube by reviewers, turn fan speed to max, shift graphic card to discrete GPU from nitro sense software.",4.0,

I uograded mine and now it's on par with good gaming laptops ( it got promoted from Decent to Good performer)Battery - not very good.

So i would call it a decent speaker with not much good qualities to it.Mux switch will come in handy if you know that you are going to play coniltinously with power adapter connected.Overall answer is that this is the best gaming experience laptop at this price point. Not the new RTX 4060 laptops as the RTX 4060 is a joke when compared with RTX 3070 Ti. But if you can spend 20k INR more, then try the all AMD Asus strix g15 advantage edition with the RX6800M and Ryzen 9 5950HX. The processor is 3 years old, and even the GPU is more than 2 years old, but the raw rasterization performance of the RX6800M is comparable to  a RTX 3080 laptop. So there is nothing even close to that powerhouse at that price range of 1.3 lakh INR.So either get this RTX 3070 Ti laptop for 1 lakh and count on Nvidia's DLSS to deliver flagship level performance or buy the RX6800M laptop for 1.3 lakh and be the proud owner of a flagship GPU.",5.0,

(3 TB total)3. Bought a simple cooling pad (They all work almost equally irrespective of no of fans and size).Everything included costed me less than 105k. Works better and faster than most 150k laptops I have tried.Apart from that, polycarbonate built but quite solid. Both looks and feels strong. Sturdy hinge and minimal top and keyboard flex.Very fast and responsive screen with high color accuracy. (I upgraded from a TN panel display laptop)Decent keyboard for both gaming and typing. Big and quite responsive trackpad.Downsides: DDR4 RAM. However, compared to DDR5 the performance difference should be around 5%, so hardly matters and not worth the extra cost.Overall a solid recommendation for those who want pure performance and not novalty features like per key RGB, metal chassis built or inbuilt mechanical keyboard, etc.",5.0,

Set the minimum below 5-10% and it should idle around 50°, very important aspect to know if you want it to last long without slowing.The laptop is very well priced in fact it's difficult to find one for it's price.

I am running AAA titles Horizon Zero Dawn, RDR2 and Elden Ring at Ultra without any issues. Having seen some people complain about things please see below points:-Heating :- Yes the laptop heats up when running heavy games, this is normal, the fans pump a lot of hot air out, this is not gonna win any awards for heat dissipation but it does the job. I have not experienced any thermal throttling despite gaming for 4+ hours continuously. Armory crate profile's can be set up, some come inbuilt to regulate the fan speeds and other settings.WIFI - This comes with WIFI 6, but could have issues with older 2.4 networks. If you are a gamer you are using ethernet anyway so doesn't matter.Expansion: Comes with 2 x 8 GB sticks can upgrade them to 2 x 16 if required in the future. Has 2 X M.2 NVMe 2280 slots so options to add storage is also there.I/O - 3 x USB 3. 1 x HDMI, 1 x USB - C :-You can connect a USB-C dock for additional ports. If you want to use G-Sync you need a USB-C to DP adapter/dock to connect to supported monitor (USB-C only has direct graphics card out)I have used this for 1 month and i am happy with the product.If you want a gaming laptop and don't have enough to buy an ROG of the same spec. This is the way.If you want to buy a laptop for anything other than gaming look elsewhere",5.0,

Plus really enjoyed the graphics - almost felt 100Ks are well spent. Games I tried so far are BattleField 1 and 5.But heats up very quickly in Balanced Mode while playing. So I did not even dare to try the Turbo mode. More specifically, the issue is that one of the path the heat dissipates through is from right hand side panel near where I keep my mouse. The heat comes directly on the mouse hand.As a solution I have started playing by keeping laptop and chair at 45 degree angle to table. That way I let my elbow rest on table and also get a lot of space to move my mouse while keeping my hand distant from right side panel.But otherwise heat control is good while working normally. Battery backup is also too good for me during normal working.All in all good product for less than 100k. I guess it was worth the while to wait this long to buy this model.",3.0,

Its around 4-6hrs on normal use like browsing, programming etc.Most of the people say there are thermal issues with the laptop but its very decent . Even I played some games like Forza Horizon on my 55inch 4k TV on ultra graphics the performance is mind blowing!! temperatures also decent around 92 degrees. Its better to lift the laptop a little bit up from the ground when  you are gaming.The built quality is really very great.Only thing which I felt a little problematic is the screen(Display) , Its good but not great!On overall basis the laptop is great !!!and I suggest/recommend you to get it....",5.0,

Go for the 3200 MHZ Crucial 16gb + 16gb upgrade, its definitely even more op with 32 gb. I also added a 1 tb NVMIE SSD as it comes with one slot filled with the 512gb, will eventually upgrade it to 2tb +2tb Nvmie later on.Also get a good cooling pad as with any gaming laptop worth its salt temperatures will maintain a highish 90 plus but never over 98 degrees so far. Get a good laptop cooler for it. Battery life is respectable when considering the output. Armor crate software lets you bling out the RGB settings.

     Its an excellent warhead for Gamers and Professionals. 16 GB ram, 512 SSD , AMD Radeon 9 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 3060 makes it super sonic. No doubt, the laptop processing speed is very fast. I played Apex Legends, Far Cry 5, Pubg PC, Wolfenstein, COD Warzone, Battlefield, Gear of war 5, Dishonored e.t.c with ultra high settings and guess what, it ran like butter.V. Good for running heavy ML/DL models. Adobe after effects is running very good.512 GB SSD and 2-2.5 hr battery life is something that is a minimal concern. Else, happy working and gaming.",5.0,
